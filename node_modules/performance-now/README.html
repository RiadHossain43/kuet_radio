<p>Implements a function similar to <code>performance.now</code> (based on <code>process.hrtime</code>).</p>
<p>Modern browsers have a <code>window.performance</code> object with - among others - a <code>now</code> method which gives time in milliseconds, but with sub-millisecond precision. This module offers the same function based on the Node.js native <code>process.hrtime</code> function.</p>
<p>Using <code>process.hrtime</code> means that the reported time will be monotonically increasing, and not subject to clock-drift.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/">High Resolution Time specification</a>, the number of milliseconds reported by <code>performance.now</code> should be relative to the value of <code>performance.timing.navigationStart</code>.</p>
<p>In the current version of the module (2.0) the reported time is relative to the time the current Node process has started (inferred from <code>process.uptime()</code>).</p>
<p>Version 1.0 reported a different time. The reported time was relative to the time the module was loaded (i.e. the time it was first <code>require</code>d). If you need this functionality, version 1.0 is still available on NPM.</p>
<h2 id="example-usage">Example usage</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var now = require(&quot;performance-now&quot;)
var start = now()
var end = now()
console.log(start.toFixed(3)) // the number of milliseconds the current node process is running
console.log((start-end).toFixed(3)) // ~ 0.002 on my system
</code></pre>
<p>Running the now function two times right after each other yields a time difference of a few microseconds. Given this overhead, I think it&#39;s best to assume that the precision of intervals computed with this method is not higher than 10 microseconds, if you don&#39;t know the exact overhead on your own system.</p>

        <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-development-policy#conduct"><em>Adapted from the Rust Code of Conduct</em></a></p>
<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</p>
<ul>
<li>On any communication medium, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</li>
<li>Please be kind and courteous. There&#39;s no need to be mean or rude.</li>
<li>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.</li>
<li>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</li>
<li>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term &quot;harassment&quot; as including the definition in the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don&#39;t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</li>
<li>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one the RxJS team immediately. Whether you&#39;re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we&#39;ve got your back.</li>
<li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.</li>
</ul>
